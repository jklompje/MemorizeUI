# MemorizeUI
 SwiftUI version of Memorize (Paul Hudson - Swift on Sundays - vol 1)
 
 NSAttributedString is currently not supported in SwiftUI. There are several workarounds.
 For example: using UILabel with NSAttributedString from UIKit and incorporating this in usual fashion.
 
 This project was an experimental playful workaround of the UIKit version of Memorize, incorporating a 
 few interesting effects to make up for the absence of NSAttributableString, by using Unicode scalar codes,
 to obscure the words and adding .font to Text views.
